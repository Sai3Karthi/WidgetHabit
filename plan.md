# Plan to Resolve Build and Kotlin Errors

## Phase 1: Address "Build failed due to use of deleted Android v1 embedding"

This error indicates that the project is configured to use an older Flutter Android embedding (v1), which has been deprecated/removed. The goal is to migrate the project to Flutter's v2 Android embedding.

### Steps:
1.  **Inspect `android/app/build.gradle` and `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`**: Verify that these files are configured for Flutter v2 embedding. This usually involves checking the `minSdkVersion`, `compileSdkVersion`, `targetSdkVersion`, and the `application` tag in the manifest.
2.  **Update `MainActivity.kt`**: Ensure `MainActivity.kt` extends `FlutterActivity` or `FlutterFragmentActivity` and is set up correctly for v2 embedding.
3.  **Run `flutter clean` and `flutter pub get`**: After making changes, perform a clean build to ensure all old build artifacts are removed and dependencies are up to date.

## Phase 2: Address "Unresolved reference 'context'" in `HabitWidgetProvider.kt`

This error means that the `context` variable is not recognized in the scope where it's being used within `HabitWidgetProvider.kt`.

### Steps:
1.  **Read `HabitWidgetProvider.kt`**: Analyze the `HabitWidgetProvider.kt` file to understand the methods and classes where `context` is being used and identify why it's out of scope.
2.  **Correct Context Usage**: Ensure that methods needing a `Context` object receive it as a parameter, or that `context` is accessed from a valid scope (e.g., within `onUpdate` or other lifecycle methods where `Context` is provided).
3.  **Test the fix**: After modifying `HabitWidgetProvider.kt`, run `flutter run` to check if the `Unresolved reference 'context'` errors are resolved.
